Scope of the Project:
The Relief & Rescue Hub is a disaster relief web platform designed to provide real-time assistance during emergencies. The primary goal is to bridge the gap between disaster victims and relief services by offering quick access to emergency resources, shelters, medical aid, and volunteer opportunities. This project integrates NASA’s EONET API to track live disaster events, ensuring users receive updated information about ongoing calamities.


Key Objectives:
• Live Disaster Tracking: Using NASA’s EONET API, the platform provides real-time updates on disasters like wildfires, floods, and earthquakes.
• Emergency Assistance: Quick access to SOS alerts, ambulance services, and hospital ICU bed availability.
• Safe Shelter Locator: Helps displaced individuals find the nearest safe shelter.
• Volunteer and Aid Delivery: Encourages community participation by enabling users to volunteer, donate, or deliver aid to affected areas.
• Crowdfunding for Relief: Allows users to set up and contribute to fundraising campaigns for disaster relief efforts.


NASA EONET API:
The NASA EONET (Earth Observatory Natural Event Tracker) API is used to fetch real-time disaster event data. It provides information about ongoing natural disasters such as wildfires, storms, earthquakes, and floods. The Relief & Rescue Hub uses this API to:
• Retrieve live disaster event data.
• Display disaster locations on an interactive map.
• Categorize events based on disaster types (e.g., wildfire, cyclone, earthquake).
• Auto-refresh data every 5 minutes to keep information updated.
• Use geolocation services to center the map based on the user’s location


Platform Functionalities:
The Relief & Rescue Hub consists of multiple functionalities, each playing a crucial role in disaster management.
1. User Authentication and Registration:
• A sign-up page is available for all donors, volunteers, and organizations contributing monetary donations, blood, medical supplies, and essential aid.
• Users can register based on their role: donor, volunteer, organization, or expert.
• Registration allows users to participate in different relief efforts and access relevant features.
2. Rescue & Medical Help:
• SOS Alerts: One-click emergency button for instant distress signals.
• Ambulance and Critical Care: Connects users to nearby ambulance services.
• Hospital ICU Beds Availability: Provides real-time data on available hospital resources.
3. Shelter & Safety:
• Find Safe Shelters: Helps users locate nearby relief shelters.
